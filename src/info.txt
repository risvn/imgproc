 image comprassing 

 cosine func
 <1 to -1>

 when we add different cosine waves with different freq it results in the complex wave which
 is sum of two

 we can do weighted sum to have a little more sensitive to particular wave

//so essientially the jpg compression is gitting rid of high frequiecy waves
divide each image in to 8*8 pixel groups and those can be represented in 
consine transform
co-ef


=====Frequecncu components in Images=====
high-frequency ->rapid change
low-frequency ->graduall change/smother changes

real world images ->low_req most of the cases
the human visual system is less sensitive to high_freq detail


========How to get get frequecy components high/low============

Discrete cosine transform (DCT)

dct takes input the sample from the original signal -> outputs the same size 
called DCT coffiecients

this coefficient represents the contrubution of different signal that gives back original signal


for example when you input the dct with cosine wave 
you get only single non-zero value (coeff) bcz there is only one signal 
contributing that is cos wave itself

as amplitude changes -> so do the coffieciet 
shifting up or down along y-axis -> effects zeroth index of ouput wave
frequency changes -> coffiecient index changes

cos(x)-> X1
cos(2x)-> X2
cos(kx)->Xk
