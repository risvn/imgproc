This guide provides a step-by-step approach to implementing perceptual hashing (pHash) in C, without relying on machine learning. The goal is to compute a 64-bit image fingerprint and compare it using Hamming distance.

### **🧠 Step 1: Understand What pHash Is**

Before diving into code, grasp the fundamental concept:

Perceptual hashing (pHash) generates a compact fingerprint of an image based on its structural and visual characteristics. It exhibits robustness against minor alterations such as changes in brightness, compression, or resizing.

### **🖼️ Step 2: Load and Resize the Image**

#### **🧩 Use stb\_image.h to Load Image**

Integrate stb\_image.h to load various image formats (JPG, PNG, etc.) into raw pixel data.

* 📥 C file: [stb\_image.c](https://www.google.com/search?q=%5Bhttps://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.c%5D\(https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.c\))

\<\!-- end list \--\>

C

\#**define** STB\_IMAGE\_IMPLEMENTATION  
\#**include** "stb\_image.h"

#### **🧩 Use stb\_image\_resize.h to Resize Image**

Resize the loaded image to a 32x32 grayscale format, which is the required input for pHash.

* 📥 [stb\_image\_resize.h](https://www.google.com/search?q=%5Bhttps://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image_resize.h%5D\(https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image_resize.h\))

\<\!-- end list \--\>

C

\#**define** STB\_IMAGE\_RESIZE\_IMPLEMENTATION  
\#**include** "stb\_image\_resize.h"

### **🔣 Step 3: Implement Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)**

You'll need a 2D DCT function to process the 32x32 image matrix.

#### **🧮 Use a Simple DCT Function**

* 📜 [Naive 2D DCT C Implementation – Gist](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://gist.github.com/phire/5815104) (suitable for small images)

For a 32x32 image, performance is not a primary concern at this stage.

### **🔢 Step 4: Generate the Perceptual Hash**

Follow these steps to generate the 64-bit perceptual hash:

1. Extract the top-left 8x8 block from the DCT result.  
2. Exclude the \[0\]\[0\] (DC) term.  
3. Compute the median of the remaining 63 values.  
4. For each of the 63 values: if the value is greater than the median, assign 1; otherwise, assign 0\.  
5. Combine these 63 bits (and one more from a consistent rule for the DC term, often 0 or based on a threshold relative to itself if it's the only value being considered) into a 64-bit hash.

**🧠 Reference Logic:**

* 🔗 [ImageHash (Python)](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/JohannesBuchner/imagehash/blob/main/imagehash/__init__.py) – provides clear pHash code that can be ported to C.

### **🧪 Step 5: Compare Hashes Using Hamming Distance**
